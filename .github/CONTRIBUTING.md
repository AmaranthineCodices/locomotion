# Contributing
Contributions are always welcome!

## Suggesting features
Suggestions for new features are always welcome. When writing a suggestion, here are some things to include:

* Examples of how this would help make Locomotion better (use cases!)
* Proposed API (how would this work?)
* As many details as possible!

## Reporting bugs
Run a quick search when you've found a bug - if it's already been reported, consider adding more details onto that issue instead. When reporting a bug, here are some important details to include:

* What you expected to happen, and why
* What actually happened
* A code snippet that clearly demonstrates the bug
* If possible, a GIF or video of the bug, if it's related to animation
* The version of Locomotion (either released version or commit hash) this happens on

## Tests
Locomotion has two general classes of test: **lemur tests**, which can be run outside of Roblox within [lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/lemur), and **Roblox tests**, which must be run within Roblox.
